#
# Each record is composed of the following pipe-separated fields.  Whitespace before or after 
# each value will be stripped when read (leaving any embedded whitespace to be treated 
# literally).  Does NOT handle embedded pipes; so don't use them:
#
# <client_id>:
#   A case-insensative string which uniquely identifies the client.
#
# <app_id_regex>:
#   Each input file to the preprocessor is associated with, what we're calling here, an 
#   "application identifier" (it's in the file name), which is a client-specific string that 
#   uniquely identifies a set of configurations (corp-level) to run the file with.
#
#   For example, for PFG files, "CGS72190.N" (see below where it's used) indicates a particular 
#   "job name" (CGS72190, a value which is used by the client to group various web API orders 
#   together) corresponding to some of their "group billing statements", followed by a "N" 
#   which stands for non-bulk delivery and a period separating the two values for readability.  
#
#   Each row in this config file corresponds to a single set of such configurations, and this 
#   field, <app_id_regex>, is a A Perl RegEx which is matched against the input file's 
#   application ID, order to find the appropriate config row below in this file to run with.
#   
#   The first config row found whose <client_id> matches the input file's client ID, and whose 
#   <app_id_regex> matches the file's application ID (both matches are case-insensative and the 
#   regex is surrounded with beginning/end-of-line anchors) will be used.
#
#   Example: If your <app_id_regex> is "ABC[01]23", it will be matched against the candidate 
#   application ID value using the regex "^ABC[01]23$" (and uses the global case-insensative 
#   flag).  If multiple rows/records below match the <client_id>/<app_id_regex> combination, 
#   then the first matching row is used; so BE MINDFUL OF THIS AND ADD YOUR NEW ENTRIES TO THE 
#   BOTTOM OF THE FILE TO HELP AVOID CAUSING REGRESSIONS for other client configurations.
#
# <prod_corps>:
#   A comma-separated list of production Infact Corps, one of which to be assigned to this run 
#   if the input is a production file.  The first corp found to have an open cycle for the 
#   month specified in the RUNDATE will be assigned to the run (in other words you may 
#   optionally specify "overflow corps" by including more than one corp in this field).  The 
#   order of the list of corps reflects the precedence of their assignment.
#   (If you're thinking of adding the option to have dashes in corps to specify a range, please 
#   do not, as it makes it impossible to grep for a particular corp number when dealing with a 
#   prod issue.)
#
# <test_corps>:
#   Optional, a comma-separated list of UAT Infact Corps.  It functions the same way as <prod 
#   corps>, but if the file is a test file, one of these test corps will be assigned to the run 
#   instead of a prod corp.
#
# <config_subdir>:
#   Every config file which is unique to the given corp range should be under this 
#   system/config/ sub-directory.
#
# <is_bulk_shipping>:
#   Y/N value; specifies whether or not the print output is assigned to bulk shipping.
#
# <pdf2afp_version>:
#   Specifies which version of the pdf2afp module to use (All older jar files will remain 
#   available; so that all corps don't need to be regression tested if only one or a few need a 
#   newer version).
#
# <modifyafp_version>:
#   Specifies which version of the modifyafp module to use (All older jar files will remain 
#   available; so that all corps don't need to be regression tested if only one or a few need a 
#   newer version).
#
# <compart_version>:
#   Specifies which version of the compart toolkit to use with the pdf2afp
#   module. (older versions will remain available).
#
# <infact_site>:
#   Specfies which Infact Site to deliver the print file to.  May be one of:
#   EDH, KC, HAR, CPL, CPL_US_ONLY
#
# <do_billing>:
#   Y/N value; specifies whether or not to execute the Billing API step. (Billing codes should 
#   come from each app's afpgen.cfg; so this step is standardized.)
#
# <comments>:
#   Any short comments which might be useful to know about this specific app/corp which aren't 
#   already covered by the other fields in this file.
#   (Primarily from an orchestration/data-flow perspective, as opposed to composition details; 
#   think about what you might want to know when called at 02:00 in the morning to troubleshoot 
#   a prod issue.)
#
# PLEASE USE ONLY SPACES (NO TABS) BELOW, TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE SEES THE SAME SPACING AND 
# KEEP THE COLUMN ALIGNMENTS CONSISTENT WHERE POSSIBLE, AS YOU ADD ROWS.
# (I suggest turning off line-wrap in your text editor, for readability, as well.)
